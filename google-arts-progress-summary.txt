GOOGLE ARTS & CULTURE IMPORT - PROGRESS SUMMARY
================================================

Current Status (as of $(date)):
- Total artworks in CSV: 16,311
- Successfully processed: 106 (0.65%)
- Remaining to process: 16,207 (99.35%)
- Status: PAUSED (429 Rate Limit Error)

Rate Limiting Issue:
- Google Arts returns 429 "Too Many Requests" errors
- Sequential processing implemented with 11-second delays between requests
- 2-minute delays after 429 errors, 1-minute after other errors
- Resume functionality: --resume flag starts from first unprocessed artwork
- Process can handle interruptions gracefully

Resume Options:
1. Wait 24+ hours for rate limits to reset, then run:
   npm run googlearts-import -- --csv downloads/GoogleImages.csv --images downloads/GoogleImages --resume
2. Monitor progress with the watch command provided

FINAL STATUS: Google Arts Import Completed with Rate Limiting Issues

Current Progress: 991/16,311 artworks (6.08% complete)
Remaining: 15,206 artworks
Latest run results: 0 successful, 57 failed (429 rate limit errors)
Total failed artworks: 222 (165 from previous + 57 from final run)

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
- Google Arts has persistent IP-based rate limiting
- Even with extended time gaps, IP blocking persists
- Successfully imported 991 artworks with full metadata
- 222 artworks failed due to rate limiting (ready for retry)

Next Steps (Future):
1. Wait 1+ week for potential IP unblocking
2. Implement VPN/proxy rotation for large-scale imports
3. Retry failed artworks: npm run googlearts-import -- --csv google-arts-failed-artworks-final.csv --images downloads/GoogleImages --force-rescrape
4. Process remaining artworks: npm run googlearts-import -- --csv google-arts-remaining.csv --images downloads/GoogleImages

Files Created:
- google-arts-remaining.csv: 15,206 artworks still to process
- google-arts-current-status.json: Complete final assessment
- google-arts-failed-artworks.json: 222 total failed artworks
- google-arts-failed-artworks-final.csv: 57 failed from final run

Monitoring Command:
watch -n 60 'node -e "
const {supabase}=require("./dist/config");
supabase.from("art_sources").select("source",{count:"exact"}).eq("source","googlearts").then(r=>console.log("Processed:",r.data?.length||0,"/ 16311"))'

Error Tracking:
- 429 Rate Limit errors: Tracked separately with 🚫 indicator
- Automatic 2-minute delays for rate limits, 1-minute for other errors
- Detailed error logging for troubleshooting
- Failed artworks saved to retry files:
  - google-arts-failed-artworks.json (detailed error info)
  - google-arts-failed-artworks.csv (subset for retry)

Resume Command (after fixing rate limiting):
npm run googlearts-import -- --csv downloads/GoogleImages.csv --images downloads/GoogleImages --force-rescrape
